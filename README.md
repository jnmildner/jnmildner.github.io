## Coding resources for beginners in Python:

- [Getting started with colab](https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=GJBs_flRovLc)
- [Python cheat sheets](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/cheat_sheets/). *Useful if you have already completed an intro course on Python or if you know another programming language (such as R) and just need syntax reminders.*

## Relevant review/tutorial papers:

- Brickman et al., 2025. [Large Language Models for Psychological Assessment: A Comprehensive Overview](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459251343582) *This is a thorough and accessible introduction to using LLMs in psychology. There is an accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mehak25/Intro-to-LLM) with a code tutorial.*

- [Transformers library documentation.](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/index)
- [Getting started with sentiment analysis.](https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python) *Includes using pretrained models, but also finetuning and training a model.*
- [Prompt engineering.](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/prompting) *Background, tips, and examples on how to write a good prompt for text generation.*
- [Zero-Shot Classification.](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification)
- [Text Classification.](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/sequence_classification)
- [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). *Comparison of hundreds of text and image embedding models on a variety of benchmarks. You can filter by lots of useful parameters, such as language, task type, model size, open-source, etc to find the current top embedding models.*
